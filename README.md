# Client-Server-application-for-file-trasfer

Server side Filer Transfer TCP Algorithm
STEP 1: Start the program.
STEP 2: Declare the variables and structure for the socket. 
STEP 3: Create a socket using socket functions
STEP 4: The socket is binded at the specified port.
STEP 5: Using the object the port and address are declared. 
STEP 6: After the binding is executed the file is specified. 
STEP 7: Then the file is specified.
STEP 8: Execute the client program.

Client side File Transfer TCP Algorithm
STEP 1: Start the program.
STEP 2: Declare the variables and structure.
STEP 3: Socket is created and connects function is executed.
STEP 4: If the connection is successful then server sends the message. 
STEP 5: The file name that is to be transferred is specified in the client side. 
STEP 6: The contents of the file is verified from the server side.
STEP 7: Stop the program
